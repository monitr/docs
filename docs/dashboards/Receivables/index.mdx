The receivables dashboard will give you an overview of all outstanding items that you still expect to receive. You can see the total, a split by the amount of time they are outstanding (aging) and by the relationship name.

By making a selection on these categories, the transaction table on the bottom will only show your selection, which gives you the possibility to do a deep dive in the outstanding items.
