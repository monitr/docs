As is clear from the title, the Key Metrics dashboard consists out of your most important metrics based on the lines in your reporting. This means that you can decide what is important to you and what you would like to see in these 5 components.

#### KPI by % of Revenue Chart
Gain insight into performance by comparing selected reporting lines - for example gross margin and net result - with your revenue. The evolution of your profitability is charted in this way so that you can detect deviations more quickly.

#### Waterfall Chart
On the basis of a waterfall chart, deviations from your budget become visible. You can see at a glance which key metrics deviate from your budget and their impact on your net result. The key figures you want to see can be chosen yourself, with always an "other" category as an addition to the graph. Thanks to the insights based on the deviations, you can make adjustments faster where necessary.
