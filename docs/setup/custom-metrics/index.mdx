You can freely tailor your reporting to your needs. 
This has the upside that it gives you insight into your business, but to perform some logical checks you will have to store some anchors in Monitr.
To make sure the validations and visualisations in Monitr work properly we need you to complete two Custom metrics:
1. Net Result: This is the bottom line result of your Profit & loss statement, we will use this to check the relation between your equity and your result.
1. Revenue: This is the reporting line in your Profit & loss statement representing your revenue. We will use this line to calculate your selected metrics as a % of revenue in the dashboard.
1. Bank: This is the cash & bank you want to display in your runway. We also use this to check if your Cash flow statement matches the mutation of your bank balance.

To setup these metrics:
- [Go to 'Custom metrics'](https://app.monitr.be/dashboard/organisations/entities/definitions/custom_metrics)
- Select the correct reporting lines in the field Reporting line
- Click <PrimaryButton>Save</PrimaryButton>
