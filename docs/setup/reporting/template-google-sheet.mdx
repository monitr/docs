## Structure of the template
The definitions can be made in the the tabsheets that are highlighted in yellow.
Each tabsheet is constructed in a similar manner with:
- The definition: this is the part that needs to be saved as a CSV file to be uploaded into Monitr.
- Extra information: fields that help you creating your definition.
- Detailed validations: Validations rules applied to each row of your definition, to avoid having errors when uploading your CSV file into Monitr.
- Validation Summary: This gives an overview of the status of each validation (out of the detailed validation). A brief summary of the validation rule is given.
