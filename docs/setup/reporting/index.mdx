## How do you define your reporting?
In Monitr you can tailor your reporting to your needs either by using our industry specific templates, by using our interface to create your custom report, or by uploading CSV files containing pre-defined reports.
The setup of your reporting can be done [here in the tab 'Reporting'](https://app.monitr.be/dashboard/organisations/entities/definitions/reporting/reporting) .

In case of CSV files you can use our [google sheets template](./template) in order to save time.

<MessageBar>Consider using industry specific templates or our google sheets template to save time.</MessageBar>


## What reports do you need to define?
Your reporting is composed out of 3 reports:
1. [Cash flow statement](./cash-flow) (tab 'Cash Flow')
1. [Profit and Loss statement](./pl-bs) (tab 'Profit & Loss')
1. [Balance sheet](./pl-bs)  (tab 'Balance sheet')

<MessageBar>Define your reports in the order indicated above to avoid errors.</MessageBar>
