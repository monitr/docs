## Setup your Profit & Loss Statement and Balance Sheet
Monitr allows you to tailor the Profit & loss statement and Balance sheet entirely to your needs. [Go to tab 'Reporting' - 'Profit&Loss' and 'Balance Sheet'](https://app.monitr.be/dashboard/organisations/entities/definitions/mapping).
This can either be done via a CSV upload or in the user interface (see below)

The Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet table contain 5 fields:
- Rank: the order in which lines of the report are shown in dashboards
- Name: the label that will be shown in dahboards for this line of the report
- Parent: This field is used to manage the subtotals of your report. e.g. to create a subtotal 'Gross margin'  of the lines 'Revenue' and 'Cost of sales'
    - Create a line 'Gross Margin'
    - Enter 'Gross Margin' in the field 'Partent' of the 'Revenue' and 'Cost of sales'
- Cash flow: this is where you allocate the transactions of your Profit & Loss statement and your Balance sheet to your Cash flow statement. For more details go to [this page](./cash-flow).
- Top Level: toggle this field on in order to indicate that this line should always be displayed as a top level line in your reporting.
