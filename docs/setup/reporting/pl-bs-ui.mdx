<Icon iconName="SkypeCheck"/> A link to the Cash Flow statement should only be made on a line that is not the parent of another line <br />

## Changing your reports
You can always change the stucture of your reports as discribed above.
When you delete a line that has [mappings](./mapping) linked to it or make this line a parent of another line, the mappings linked to this reporting line will be deleted.
A warning will be shown before deleting the [mappings](./mapping)
