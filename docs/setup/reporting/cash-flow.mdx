## What is the Cash flow statement?
A Cash flow statement gives an overview of the sources and the use of funds for a certain period of time.
You can create a Cash flow statement in two ways:
1. Direct Cash flow statement: allocating each transaction in your cash & bank to a category
1. Indirect Cash flow statement: calculated based on the transactions in your general ledger accounts (other then your cash & bank)

Monitr uses the indirect method to calculate the Cash flow. We will allocate transactions from the Profit & loss statement and the Balance sheet to categories in the Cash flow statement.
Cash & Bank accounts, and accounts that don't have a cash impact (see some examples [here](/examples-cf))

<MessageBar>The Cash statement needs to be defined in order to define Profit & loss statement and Balance sheet.</MessageBar>

## Setup a Cash flow statement
Monitr allows you to tailor the Cash flow statement entirely to your needs. [Go to tab 'Reporting' - 'Cash Flow'](https://app.monitr.be/dashboard/organisations/entities/definitions/mapping).
This can either be done via a CSV upload or in the user interface (see below)
The Cash Flow table contains three fields:
- Rank: the order in which lines of the cash flow are shown in dashboards
- Name: the label that will be shown in dahboards for this line of the cash flow
- Parent: This field is used to manage the subtotals of your Cash flow statement. e.g. to create a subtotal 'Total cash flow'  of the lines 'Operational cash flow' and 'Financial cash flow'
    - Create a line ''Total cash flow'
    - Enter 'Total cash flow' in the field 'Partent' of the 'Operational cash flow' and 'Financial cash flow'
