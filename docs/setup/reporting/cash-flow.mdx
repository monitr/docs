## What is a Cash flow statement?
A Cash flow statement gives an overview of the sources and the use of funds for a certain period of time.
You can create a Cash flow statement in two ways:
1. Direct Cash flow statement: allocating each transaction in your cash & bank to a category
1. Indirect Cash flow statement: calculated based on the transactions in your general ledger accounts (other then your cash & bank)

Monitr uses the indirect method to calculate the Cash flow. We will allocate transactions from the Profit & loss statement and the Balance sheet to categories in the Cash flow statement.
Cash & Bank accounts, and accounts that don't have a cash impact (see some examples [here](/examples-cf))

<MessageBar>The Cash statement needs to be defined in order to create your Profit & loss statement and Balance sheet.</MessageBar>

## Setup a Cash flow statement
Monitr allows you to tailor the Cash flow statement entirely to your needs. [Go to tab 'Reporting' - 'Cash Flow'](https://app.monitr.be/dashboard/organisations/entities/definitions/reporting/reporting/CF).
This can either be done via the user interface or by uploading a CSV file (see below).

The Cash Flow table contains two fields:

- Name: the label that will be shown in dashboards for this line of the cash flow
- Top: toggle this field on in order to indicate that this line should always be displayed as a top level line in your reporting.
