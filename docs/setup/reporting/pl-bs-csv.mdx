You can either upload a pre-defined template (such as this file) or use tabsheet 'Reporting' our [google sheets template](/setup/template) to define your Cash flow statement.

## Definition
Complete the folowing fields in the template
- ID [string]: a unique identifier for the line in your report
- Name [string]: the label shown in the reporting
- Rank [integer]: defines the order in which the items are shown in the report
- Parent [string]: used to define subtotals in the reporting. Enter the ID of the parent.
- Report [string]: the report 
- Top [1/0]: Used to indicate what lines should always appear as top level in the reporting (1: top level; 0: not top level)
- CF_ID [string]: this is the ID of the Cash Flow table. It is used to map your balance sheet and cash flow lines to the cash flow statement. Not all lines need to be mapped (e.g. bank will not be mapped)

<MessageBar>You can only create a link from a line that is not the parent of another line, and to a line in the Cash flow statement that is not the parent of antorher line</MessageBar>
