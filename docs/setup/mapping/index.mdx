## What are mappings?
In the table mapping you will link the transactions on your general ledger to your Profit & loss statement and Balance sheet.
Mappings can be made either on a general ledger account or if applicable on the combination of a general ledger account and a selected analytical axis.

## How can you use analytical axis in mappings?
E.g. if you use the cost centers in Exact Online to register costs per department, you can map the combination of the general ledger account '620500 - Wages' and cost center 'Sales' to the reporting line 'Personnel Costs - Sales' in your Profit & loss statement.

Before you can use analytical axis in your mappings you need to select what axis to use in the [settings of your entity](https://app.monitr.be/dashboard/organisations/entities).
Select the analytical axis you would like to use and click <PrimaryButton>Save</PrimaryButton>.

You can select to following options (if used in your accounting):
- None
- Cost Center (Exact Online)
- Cost Unit (Exact Online)
- Project (Yuki, Exact Online) <br />
