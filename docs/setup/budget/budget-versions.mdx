## What are budget versions?
Monitr allows you to manage multiple versions of your budget.
These budgets will be used to compare versus your actuals and to calculate your forecasts.

There Monitr allows you to define multiple types of budget:
- Initial budget: this is the budget that is used to compare versus my actuals. Typically this is the budget approved by your board.
- Active budget: this is the budget that is used to calculate your forecasts <br />

<MessageBar>For Monitr to function properly you need to have indicated at least one budget as 'initial'and one budget as 'active'.</MessageBar> <br />

The budget version table contains the folowing fields:
- Name: a unique name for the budget version
- Date: date the budget version was created in Monitr
- Initial: Toggle to indicate that a budget version is used as an initial budget. 
- Active: Toggle to indicate that a budget version is used as an active budget. 
- Budget Type: Indicated the source of the budget. 
- Comment: optional comments

<MessageBar>Multiple budgets can be put as 'Active' or 'Initial'. The data of these budgets will be aggregated for calculations.</MessageBar>
