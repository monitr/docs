You can manage different versions of your budget via Monitr ([see Budget Versions](./budget-versions)).
Use the droplist 'Budget Version' to select the budget you want to display or change.
In this droplist you can also create a new budget version by clicking '+ new budget version'. 

<MessageBar>If you have created a new budget version via '+ new budget version' on this page, don't forget to set it as an 'initial' or 'active' budget on the 'budget verions' page</MessageBar>

We recommend to upload your budget as a CSV file, but you can also manage your budget mannually in our user interface.
