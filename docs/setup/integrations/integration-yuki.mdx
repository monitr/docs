You will need to create a Yuki API key to be able to add the integration. You can find more information on the [documentation page of Yuki](https://support.yuki.be/nl/support/solutions/articles/11000065506-hoe-leg-ik-een-koppeling-). Once you've created an API key, fill it in and click <PrimaryButton>Save</PrimaryButton>.
