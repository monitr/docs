Before you can use Monitr, you will have to set up an integration to connect to your accounting software.  
To setup your integration, navigate to [<Icon iconName="PlugConnected" /> Integrations](https://app.monitr.be/dashboard/manage/integrations) in the sidebar.

## Add an integration

Click <ActionButton iconProps={{ iconName: 'Add' }}>Add</ActionButton> at the top of the page and select your accounting software provider.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yuki"
  values={[
    { label: "Yuki", value: "yuki" },
    { label: "Exact Online", value: "exact_online" },
    { label: "Afas (Soon)", value: "afas" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="yuki">
    <YukiIntegration />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="exact_online">
    <ExactIntegration />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="afas">
    <AfasIntegration />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you've added your integration, we will automatically start importing all required data from your accounting provider in the background.

<MessageBar>The initial import might take a while depending on the amount of data.</MessageBar>

## Data synchronisation

Monitr will get data from your accounts, analytical accounts and general ledger each night. This way your dashboard will always give you an up to date view on your accounts.
The data will be updated from the _last actuals_ date that you can set in the [<Icon iconName="Org" /> Entities](https://app.monitr.be/dashboard/organisations/entities) settings. If data prior to the _last actuals_ needs to be updated, change the _last actuals_ to an earlier date, the data will refresh overnight. Set your _last actuals_ to the correct date, after the data has been refreshed.

In addition, you can sync your data manually by clicking the <ActionButton iconProps={{ iconName: 'Sync' }}>Sync now</ActionButton> button in the [<Icon iconName="Org" /> Entities](https://app.monitr.be/dashboard/organisations/entities) settings.
