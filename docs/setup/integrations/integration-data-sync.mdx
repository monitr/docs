Once you've added your integration, we will automatically start importing all required data from your accounting provider in the background.

## Data synchronisation

Monitr will get data from your accounts, analytical accounts and general ledger each night. This way your dashboard will always give you an up to date view on your accounts.
The data will be updated from the _last actuals_ date that you can set in the [<Icon iconName="Org" /> Entities](https://app.monitr.be/dashboard/organisations/entities) settings. If data prior to the _last actuals_ needs to be updated, change the _last actuals_ to an earlier date, the data will refresh overnight. Set your _last actuals_ to the correct date, after the data has been refreshed.

In addition, you can sync your data manually by clicking the <ActionButton iconProps={{ iconName: 'Sync' }}>Sync now</ActionButton> button in the [<Icon iconName="Org" /> Entities](https://app.monitr.be/dashboard/organisations/entities) settings.
