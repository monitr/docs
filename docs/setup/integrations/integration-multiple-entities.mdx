If you have multiple entities connected to your credentials, Monitr will show you an entity selection screen where you can decide which you want to import and use in Monitr. If you change your mind in the future you can always enable or disable entities in the [<Icon iconName="Org" /> Entities](https://app.monitr.be/dashboard/organisations/entities) settings.
